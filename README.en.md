## Questions and Notes

1.  MacOS, the bundle generated by cmake is not generated under the .app/Contents/ folder`PkgInfo`document;
    1.  [app/CMakeLists](/apps/app/CMakeLists.txt), using this CMakeLists.txt can generate bundles on MacOS, and can also display icons normally, but there is no PkgInfo file;
    2.  How should cmake generate PkgInfo files?
    3.  qmake will generate PkgInfo file by default, only need to specify`TARGET=app`or`CONFIG+=bundle`can;
2.  Under the Unix system, it is necessary to use the static library as much as possible to avoid the dependency problem of the dynamic library;
    1.  Several modules in this project are dynamic libraries, because they are plugins, they need to be loaded dynamically;
    2.  Then you need to package these dynamic libraries, and then load them at runtime, and you also need to rpath`"-Wl,-rpath,\'\$$ORIGIN\':\'\$$ORIGIN/lib\':'\$$ORIGIN/../lib'")`, make settings, otherwise the dynamic library will not be found;
    3.  Or use install_name_tool (macos), patchelf/chrpath (linux) to modify the dependency path of the dynamic library, which is very troublesome;
    4.  Also consider that these libraries can be shared, so don't pack them repeatedly;
    5.  You can see the details[workflows](.github/workflows/cmake.yml)；
