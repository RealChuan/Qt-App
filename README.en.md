## Questions and comments

-   MacOS, the bundle generated by cmake is not generated in the .app/Contents/ folder`PkgInfo`document;
    1.  [app/CMakeLists](/apps/app/CMakeLists.txt), use this CMakeLists.txt to generate a bundle on MacOS, and the icon can be displayed normally, but there is no PkgInfo file;
    2.  How does cmake generate PkgInfo files?
        1.  WireShark use`set_source_files_properties(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/PkgInfo PROPERTIES MACOSX_PACKAGE_LOCATION .)`In a similar way, copy it to the bundle;
    3.  qmake will generate a PkgInfo file by default, you only need to specify`TARGET=app`or`CONFIG+=bundle`That’s it;

-   Under Unix systems, you need to use static libraries as much as possible to avoid dependence on dynamic libraries;
    1.  Several modules in this project are dynamic libraries, and because they are plugins, they need to be loaded dynamically;
    2.  Then you need to package these dynamic libraries and load them at runtime. You also need to modify the rpath`"-Wl,-rpath,\'\$$ORIGIN\':\'\$$ORIGIN/lib\':'\$$ORIGIN/../lib'")`, set it, otherwise the dynamic library will not be found;
    3.  Or use install_name_tool (macos), patchelf/chrpath (linux) to modify the dependency path of the dynamic library, which is very troublesome;
    4.  Also consider that these libraries can be shared, so do not package them repeatedly;
    5.  For details, please see[workflows](.github/workflows/cmake.yml)；

-   MacOS，[vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)Issues with compiling third-party libraries;
    1.  because[vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)at present[Only supports separate compilation of x64-osx and arm64-osx](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/discussions/19454)；
    2.  In use[cmake](.github/workflows/cmake.yml), you need to specify`CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64`or`CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64`;
    3.  In use[qmake](.github/workflows/qmake.yml), you need to specify`QMAKE_APPLE_DEVICE_ARCHS=x86_64`or`QMAKE_APPLE_DEVICE_ARCHS=arm64`；
