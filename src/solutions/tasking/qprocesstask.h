// Deleting a running QProcess may block the caller thread up to 30 seconds and issue warnings.
// To avoid these issues we move the running QProcess into a separate thread
// managed by the internal ProcessReaper, instead of deleting it immediately.
// Inside the ProcessReaper's thread we try to finish the process in a most gentle way:
// we call QProcess::terminate() with 500 ms timeout, and if the process is still running
// after this timeout passed, we call QProcess::kill() and wait for the process to finish.
// All these handlings are done is a separate thread, so the main thread doesn't block at all
// when the QProcessTask is destructed.
// Finally, on application quit, QProcessDeleter::deleteAll() should be called in order
// to synchronize all the processes being still potentially reaped in a separate thread.
// The call to QProcessDeleter::deleteAll() is blocking in case some processes
// are still being reaped.
// This strategy seems most sensible, since when passing the running QProcess into the
// ProcessReaper we don't block immediately, but postpone the possible (not certain) block
// until the end of an application.
// In this way we terminate the running processes in the most safe way and keep the main thread
// responsive. That's a common case when the running application wants to terminate the QProcess
// immediately (e.g. on Cancel button pressed), without keeping and managing the handle
// to the still running QProcess.

// The implementation of the internal reaper is inspired by the Utils::ProcessReaper taken
// from the QtCreator codebase.
