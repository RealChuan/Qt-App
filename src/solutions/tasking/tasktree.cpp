    \brief A class template for implementing custom task adapters.
    \reentrant

    The TaskAdapter class template is responsible for creating a task of the \c Task type,
    starting it, and reporting success or an error when the task is finished.
    It also associates the adapter with a given \c Task type.

    Reimplement this class with the actual \c Task type to adapt the task's interface
    into the general TaskTree's interface for managing the \c Task instances.

    Each subclass needs to provide a public default constructor,
    implement the start() method, and emit the done() signal when the task is finished.
    Use task() to access the associated \c Task instance.

    To use your task adapter inside the task tree, create an alias to the
    Tasking::CustomTask template passing your task adapter as a template parameter:
    \code
        // Defines actual worker
        class Worker {...};

        // Adapts Worker's interface to work with task tree
        class WorkerTaskAdapter : public TaskAdapter<Worker> {...};

        // Defines WorkerTask as a new custom task type to be placed inside Group items
        using WorkerTask = CustomTask<WorkerTaskAdapter>;
    \endcode

    Optionally, you may pass a custom \c Deleter for the associated \c Task
    as a second template parameter of your \c TaskAdapter subclass.
    When the \c Deleter parameter is omitted, the \c std::default_delete<Task> is used by default.
    The custom \c Deleter is useful when the destructor of the running \c Task
    may potentially block the caller thread. Instead of blocking, the custom deleter may move
    the running task into a separate thread and implement the blocking destruction there.
    In this way, the fast destruction (seen from the caller thread) of the running task
    with a blocking destructor may be achieved.

    For more information on implementing the custom task adapters, refer to \l {Task Adapters}.

    \class Tasking::Storage
    \inheaderfile solutions/tasking/tasktree.h
    \inmodule TaskingSolution
    \brief A class template for custom data exchange in the running task tree.
    \reentrant

    The Storage class template is responsible for dynamically creating and destructing objects
    of the custom \c StorageStruct type. The creation and destruction are managed by the
    running task tree. If a Storage object is placed inside a \l {Tasking::Group} {Group} element,
    the running task tree creates the \c StorageStruct object when the group is started and before
    the group's setup handler is called. Later, whenever any handler inside this group is called,
    the task tree activates the previously created instance of the \c StorageStruct object.
    This includes all tasks' and groups' setup and done handlers inside the group where the
    Storage object was placed, also within the nested groups.
    When a copy of the Storage object is passed to the handler via the lambda capture,
    the handler may access the instance activated by the running task tree via the
    \l {Tasking::Storage::operator->()} {operator->()},
    \l {Tasking::Storage::operator*()} {operator*()}, or activeStorage() method.
    If two handlers capture the same Storage object, one of them may store a custom data there,
    and the other may read it afterwards.
    When the group is finished, the previously created instance of the \c StorageStruct
    object is destroyed after the group's done handler is called.

    An example of data exchange between tasks:

    \code
        const Storage<QString> storage;

        const auto onFirstDone = [storage](const Task &task) {
            // Assings QString, taken from the first task result, to the active QString instance
            // of the Storage object.
            *storage = task.getResultAsString();
        };

        const auto onSecondSetup = [storage](Task &task) {
            // Reads QString from the active QString instance of the Storage object and use it to
            // configure the second task before start.
            task.configureWithString(*storage);
        };

        const Group root {
            // The running task tree creates QString instance when root in entered
            storage,
            // The done handler of the first task stores the QString in the storage
            TaskItem(..., onFirstDone),
            // The setup handler of the second task reads the QString from the storage
            TaskItem(onSecondSetup, ...)
        };
    \endcode

    Since the root group executes its tasks sequentially, the \c onFirstDone handler
    is always called before the \c onSecondSetup handler. This means that the QString data,
    read from the \c storage inside the \c onSecondSetup handler's body,
    has already been set by the \c onFirstDone handler.
    You can always rely on it in \l {Tasking::sequential} {sequential} execution mode.

    The Storage internals are shared between all of its copies. That is why the copies of the
    Storage object inside the handlers' lambda captures still refer to the same Storage instance.
    You may place multiple Storage objects inside one \l {Tasking::Group} {Group} element,
    provided that they do not include copies of the same Storage object.
    Otherwise, an assert is triggered at runtime that includes an error message.
    However, you can place copies of the same Storage object in different
    \l {Tasking::Group} {Group} elements of the same recipe. In this case, the running task
    tree will create multiple instances of the \c StorageStruct objects (one for each copy)
    and storage shadowing will take place. Storage shadowing works in a similar way
    to C++ variable shadowing inside the nested blocks of code:

    \code
        Storage<QString> storage;

        const Group root {
            storage,                             // Top copy, 1st instance of StorageStruct
            onGroupSetup([storage] { ... }),     // Top copy is active
            Group {
                storage,                         // Nested copy, 2nd instance of StorageStruct,
                                                 // shadows Top copy
                onGroupSetup([storage] { ... }), // Nested copy is active
            },
            Group {
                onGroupSetup([storage] { ... }), // Top copy is active
            }
        };
    \endcode

    The Storage objects may also be used for passing the initial data to the executed task tree,
    and for reading the final data out of the task tree before it finishes.
    To do this, use \l {TaskTree::onStorageSetup()} {onStorageSetup()} or
    \l {TaskTree::onStorageDone()} {onStorageDone()}, respectively.

    \note If you use an unreachable Storage object inside the handler,
          because you forgot to place the storage in the recipe,
          or placed it, but not in any handler's ancestor group,
          you may expect a crash, preceded by the following message:
          \e {The referenced storage is not reachable in the running tree.
          A nullptr will be returned which might lead to a crash in the calling code.
          It is possible that no storage was added to the tree,
          or the storage is not reachable from where it is referenced.}

    GroupItem is a basic element that may be a part of any \l {Tasking::Group} {Group}.
    It encapsulates the functionality provided by any GroupItem's subclass.
    It is a value type and it is safe to copy the GroupItem instance,
    even when it is originally created via the subclass' constructor.

    There are four main kinds of GroupItem:
    \table
    \header
        \li GroupItem Kind
        \li Brief Description
    \row
        \li \l CustomTask

            Aliased with a unique task name, such as, \c ConcurrentCallTask<ResultType>
            or \c NetworkQueryTask. Asynchronous tasks are the main reason for using a task tree.
    \row
        \li \l {Tasking::Group} {Group}
        \li A container for other group items. Since the group is of the GroupItem type,
            it's possible to nest it inside another group. The group is seen by its parent
            as a single asynchronous task.
    \row
        \li GroupItem containing \l {Tasking::Storage} {Storage}
        \li Enables the child tasks of a group to exchange data. When GroupItem containing
            \l {Tasking::Storage} {Storage} is placed inside a group, the task tree instantiates
            the storage's data object just before the group is entered,

    its \a items.

    This constructor is useful when constructing a \l {Tasking::Group} {Group} element with
    lists of \c GroupItem elements:

    \brief Group represents the basic element for composing declarative recipes describing
           how to execute and handle a nested tree of asynchronous tasks.
    \reentrant

    Group is a container for other group items. It encloses child tasks into one unit,
    which is seen by the group's parent as a single, asynchronous task.
    Since Group is of the GroupItem type, it may also be a child of Group.

    Insert child tasks into the group by using aliased custom task names, such as,
    \c ConcurrentCallTask<ResultType> or \c NetworkQueryTask:

    \code
        const Group group {
            NetworkQueryTask(...),
            ConcurrentCallTask<int>(...)
        };
    \endcode

    The group's behavior may be customized by inserting the items returned by
    \l {Tasking::parallelLimit()} {parallelLimit()} or
    \l {Tasking::workflowPolicy()} {workflowPolicy()} functions:

    \code
        const Group group {
            parallel,
            continueOnError,
            NetworkQueryTask(...),
            NetworkQueryTask(...)
        };
    \endcode

    The group may contain nested groups:

    \code
        const Group group {
            finishAllAndSuccess,
            NetworkQueryTask(...),
            Group {
                NetworkQueryTask(...),
                Group {
                    parallel,
                    NetworkQueryTask(...),
                    NetworkQueryTask(...),
                }
                ConcurrentCallTask<QString>(...)
            }
        };
    \endcode

    The group may dynamically instantiate a custom storage structure, which may be used for
    inter-task data exchange:

    \code
        struct MyCustomStruct { QByteArray data; };

        Storage<MyCustomStruct> storage;

        const auto onFirstSetup = [](NetworkQuery &task) { ... };

            storage->data = task.reply()->readAll();
        };

            // storage-> gives a pointer to MyCustomStruct. Since the group is sequential,
            // the stored MyCustomStruct was already updated inside the onFirstDone handler.
            const QByteArray storedData = storage->data;
        };

        const Group group {
            // When the group is entered by a running task tree, it creates MyCustomStruct
            // instance dynamically. It is later accessible from all handlers via

    Type alias for \c std::function<SetupResult(Task &)>.

    The \c TaskSetupHandler is an optional argument of a custom task element's constructor.
    Any function with the above signature, when passed as a task setup handler,
    will be called by the running task tree after the task is created and before it is started.

    Inside the body of the handler, you may configure the task according to your needs.
    The additional parameters, including storages, may be passed to the handler
    via the lambda capture.
    You can decide dynamically whether the task should be started or skipped with
    success or an error.

    \note Do not start the task inside the start handler by yourself. Leave it for TaskTree,
    otherwise the behavior is undefined.

    The return value of the handler instructs the running task tree on how to proceed
    after the handler's invocation is finished. The return value of SetupResult::Continue
    instructs the task tree to continue running, that is, to execute the associated \c Task.
    The return value of SetupResult::StopWithSuccess or SetupResult::StopWithError
    instructs the task tree to skip the task's execution and finish it immediately with
    success or an error, respectively.

    When the return type is either SetupResult::StopWithSuccess or SetupResult::StopWithError,
    the task's done handler (if provided) isn't called afterwards.

    The constructor of a custom task accepts also functions in the shortened form of
    \c std::function<void(Task &)>, that is, the return value is \c void.
    In this case, it's assumed that the return value is SetupResult::Continue.

    Type alias for \c std::function<DoneResult(const Task &, DoneWith)> or DoneResult.

    The \c TaskDoneHandler is an optional argument of a custom task element's constructor.
    Any function with the above signature, when passed as a task done handler,
    will be called by the running task tree after the task execution finished and before
    the final result of the execution is reported back to the parent group.

    Inside the body of the handler you may retrieve the final data from the finished task.
    The additional parameters, including storages, may be passed to the handler
    via the lambda capture.
    It is also possible to decide dynamically whether the task should finish with its return
    value, or the final result should be tweaked.

    The DoneWith argument is optional and your done handler may omit it.
    When provided, it holds the info about the final result of a task that will be
    reported to its parent.

    If you do not plan to read any data from the finished task,
    you may omit the \c {const Task &} argument.

    The returned DoneResult value is optional and your handler may return \c void instead.
    In this case, the final result of the task will be equal to the value indicated by
    the DoneWith argument. When the handler returns the DoneResult value,
    the task's final result may be tweaked inside the done handler's body by the returned value.

/*!
    \enum Tasking::WorkflowPolicy

    This enum describes the possible behavior of the Group element when any group's child task
    finishes its execution. It's also used when the running Group is canceled.

    \value StopOnError
        Default. Corresponds to the stopOnError global element.
        If any child task finishes with an error, the group stops and finishes with an error.
        If all child tasks finished with success, the group finishes with success.
        If a group is empty, it finishes with success.
    \value ContinueOnError
        Corresponds to the continueOnError global element.
        Similar to stopOnError, but in case any child finishes with an error,
        the execution continues until all tasks finish, and the group reports an error
        afterwards, even when some other tasks in the group finished with success.
        If all child tasks finish successfully, the group finishes with success.
        If a group is empty, it finishes with success.
    \value StopOnSuccess
        Corresponds to the stopOnSuccess global element.
        If any child task finishes with success, the group stops and finishes with success.
        If all child tasks finished with an error, the group finishes with an error.
        If a group is empty, it finishes with an error.
    \value ContinueOnSuccess
        Corresponds to the continueOnSuccess global element.
        Similar to stopOnSuccess, but in case any child finishes successfully,
        the execution continues until all tasks finish, and the group reports success
        afterwards, even when some other tasks in the group finished with an error.
        If all child tasks finish with an error, the group finishes with an error.
        If a group is empty, it finishes with an error.
    \value StopOnSuccessOrError
        Corresponds to the stopOnSuccessOrError global element.
        The group starts as many tasks as it can. When any task finishes,
        the group stops and reports the task's result.
        Useful only in parallel mode.
        In sequential mode, only the first task is started, and when finished,
        the group finishes too, so the other tasks are always skipped.
        If a group is empty, it finishes with an error.
    \value FinishAllAndSuccess
        Corresponds to the finishAllAndSuccess global element.
        The group executes all tasks and ignores their return results. When all
        tasks finished, the group finishes with success.
        If a group is empty, it finishes with success.
    \value FinishAllAndError
        Corresponds to the finishAllAndError global element.
        The group executes all tasks and ignores their return results. When all
        tasks finished, the group finishes with an error.
        If a group is empty, it finishes with an error.

    Whenever a child task's result causes the Group to stop, that is,
    in case of StopOnError, StopOnSuccess, or StopOnSuccessOrError policies,
    the Group cancels the other running child tasks (if any - for example in parallel mode),
    and skips executing tasks it has not started yet (for example, in the sequential mode -
    those, that are placed after the failed task). Both canceling and skipping child tasks
    may happen when parallelLimit() is used.

    The table below summarizes the differences between various workflow policies:

    If a child of a group is also a group, the child group runs its tasks according to its own
    workflow policy. When a parent group stops the running child group because
    of parent group's workflow policy, that is, when the StopOnError, StopOnSuccess,
    or StopOnSuccessOrError policy was used for the parent,
    the child group's result is reported according to the

    The \a limit defines the maximum number of direct child tasks running in parallel:

    \list
        \li When \a limit equals to 0, there is no limit, and all direct child tasks are started
        together, in the oder in which they appear in a group. This means the fully parallel
        execution, and the \l parallel element may be used instead.

        \li When \a limit equals to 1, it means that only one child task may run at the time.
        This means the sequential execution, and the \l sequential element may be used instead.
        In this case, child tasks run in chain, so the next child task starts after
        the previous child task has finished.

        \li When other positive number is passed as \a limit, the group's child tasks run
        in parallel, but with a limited number of tasks running simultanously.
        The \e limit defines the maximum number of tasks running in parallel in a group.
        When the group is started, the first batch of tasks is started
        (the number of tasks in a batch equals to the passed \a limit, at most),
        while the others are kept waiting. When any running task finishes,
        the group starts the next remaining one, so that the \e limit of simultaneously
        running tasks inside a group isn't exceeded. This repeats on every child task's
        finish until all child tasks are started. This enables you to limit the maximum
        number of tasks that run simultaneously, for example if running too many processes might
        block the machine for a long time.
    \endlist

    In all execution modes, a group starts tasks in the oder in which they appear.

    If a child of a group is also a group, the child group runs its tasks according
    to its own execution mode.

    \class Tasking::TaskTree
    \inheaderfile solutions/tasking/tasktree.h
    \inmodule TaskingSolution
    \brief The TaskTree class runs an async task tree structure defined in a declarative way.
    \reentrant

    Use the Tasking namespace to build extensible, declarative task tree
    structures that contain possibly asynchronous tasks, such as QProcess,
    NetworkQuery, or ConcurrentCall<ReturnType>. TaskTree structures enable you
    to create a sophisticated mixture of a parallel or sequential flow of tasks
    in the form of a tree and to run it any time later.

    \section1 Root Element and Tasks

    The TaskTree has a mandatory Group root element, which may contain
    any number of tasks of various types, such as QProcessTask, NetworkQueryTask,
    or ConcurrentCallTask<ReturnType>:

    \code
        using namespace Tasking;

        const Group root {
            QProcessTask(...),
            NetworkQueryTask(...),
            ConcurrentCallTask<int>(...)
        };

        TaskTree *taskTree = new TaskTree(root);
        connect(taskTree, &TaskTree::done, ...);  // finish handler
        taskTree->start();
    \endcode

    The task tree above has a top level element of the Group type that contains
    tasks of the QProcessTask, NetworkQueryTask, and ConcurrentCallTask<int> type.
    After taskTree->start() is called, the tasks are run in a chain, starting
    with QProcessTask. When the QProcessTask finishes successfully, the NetworkQueryTask
    task is started. Finally, when the network task finishes successfully, the
    ConcurrentCallTask<int> task is started.

    When the last running task finishes with success, the task tree is considered
    to have run successfully and the done() signal is emitted with DoneWith::Success.
    When a task finishes with an error, the execution of the task tree is stopped
    and the remaining tasks are skipped. The task tree finishes with an error and
    sends the TaskTree::done() signal with DoneWith::Error.

    \section1 Groups

    The parent of the Group sees it as a single task. Like other tasks,
    the group can be started and it can finish with success or an error.
    The Group elements can be nested to create a tree structure:

    \code
        const Group root {
            Group {
                parallel,
                QProcessTask(...),
                ConcurrentCallTask<int>(...)
            },
            NetworkQueryTask(...)
        };
    \endcode

    The example above differs from the first example in that the root element has
    a subgroup that contains the QProcessTask and ConcurrentCallTask<int>. The subgroup is a
    sibling element of the NetworkQueryTask in the root. The subgroup contains an
    additional \e parallel element that instructs its Group to execute its tasks
    in parallel.

    So, when the tree above is started, the QProcessTask and ConcurrentCallTask<int> start
    immediately and run in parallel. Since the root group doesn't contain a
    \e parallel element, its direct child tasks are run in sequence. Thus, the
    NetworkQueryTask starts when the whole subgroup finishes. The group is
    considered as finished when all its tasks have finished. The order in which
    the tasks finish is not relevant.

    So, depending on which task lasts longer (QProcessTask or ConcurrentCallTask<int>), the
    following scenarios can take place:

    \table
    \header
        \li Scenario 1
        \li Scenario 2
    \row
        \li Root Group starts
        \li Root Group starts
    \row
        \li Sub Group starts
        \li Sub Group starts

        \li QProcessTask starts
        \li QProcessTask starts
    \row
        \li ConcurrentCallTask<int> starts
        \li ConcurrentCallTask<int> starts
    \row
        \li ...
        \li ...
    \row
        \li \b {QProcessTask finishes}
        \li \b {ConcurrentCallTask<int> finishes}
    \row
        \li ...
        \li ...
    \row
        \li \b {ConcurrentCallTask<int> finishes}
        \li \b {QProcessTask finishes}
    \row
        \li Sub Group finishes
        \li Sub Group finishes
    \row
        \li NetworkQueryTask starts
        \li NetworkQueryTask starts
    \row
        \li ...
        \li ...
    \row
        \li NetworkQueryTask finishes
        \li NetworkQueryTask finishes
    \row
        \li Root Group finishes
        \li Root Group finishes
    \endtable

    The differences between the scenarios are marked with bold. Three dots mean
    that an unspecified amount of time passes between previous and next events
    (a task or tasks continue to run). No dots between events
    means that they occur synchronously.

    The presented scenarios assume that all tasks run successfully. If a task
    fails during execution, the task tree finishes with an error. In particular,
    when QProcessTask finishes with an error while ConcurrentCallTask<int> is still being executed,
    the ConcurrentCallTask<int> is automatically canceled, the subgroup finishes with an error,
    the NetworkQueryTask is skipped, and the tree finishes with an error.

    \section1 Task Types

    Each task type is associated with its corresponding task class that executes
    the task. For example, a QProcessTask inside a task tree is associated with
    the QProcess class that executes the process. The associated objects are
    automatically created, started, and destructed exclusively by the task tree
    at the appropriate time.

    If a root group consists of five sequential QProcessTask tasks, and the task tree
    executes the group, it creates an instance of QProcess for the first
    QProcessTask and starts it. If the QProcess instance finishes successfully,
    the task tree destructs it and creates a new QProcess instance for the
    second QProcessTask, and so on. If the first task finishes with an error, the task
    tree stops creating QProcess instances, and the root group finishes with an
    error.

    The following table shows examples of task types and their corresponding task
    classes:

    \table
    \header
        \li Task Type (Tasking Namespace)
        \li Associated Task Class
        \li Brief Description
    \row
        \li QProcessTask
        \li QProcess
        \li Starts process.
    \row
        \li ConcurrentCallTask<ReturnType>
        \li Tasking::ConcurrentCall<ReturnType>
        \li Starts asynchronous task, runs in separate thread.
    \row
        \li TaskTreeTask
        \li Tasking::TaskTree
        \li Starts nested task tree.
    \row
        \li NetworkQueryTask
        \li NetworkQuery
        \li Starts network download.
    \endtable

    \section1 Task Handlers

    Use Task handlers to set up a task for execution and to enable reading
    the output data from the task when it finishes with success or an error.

    \section2 Task's Start Handler

    When a corresponding task class object is created and before it's started,
    the task tree invokes an optionally user-provided setup handler. The setup
    handler should always take a \e reference to the associated task class object:

    \code
        const auto onSetup = [](QProcess &process) {
            process.setProgram("sleep");
            process.setArguments({"3"});
        };
        const Group root {
            QProcessTask(onSetup)
        };
    \endcode

    You can modify the passed QProcess in the setup handler, so that the task
    tree can start the process according to your configuration.
    You should not call \c {process.start();} in the setup handler,
    as the task tree calls it when needed. The setup handler is optional. When used,
    it must be the first argument of the task's constructor.

    Optionally, the setup handler may return a SetupResult. The returned
    SetupResult influences the further start behavior of a given task. The
    possible values are:

    \table
    \header
        \li SetupResult Value
        \li Brief Description
    \row
        \li Continue
        \li The task will be started normally. This is the default behavior when the
            setup handler doesn't return SetupResult (that is, its return type is
            void).
    \row
        \li StopWithSuccess
        \li The task won't be started and it will report success to its parent.
    \row
        \li StopWithError
        \li The task won't be started and it will report an error to its parent.
    \endtable

    This is useful for running a task only when a condition is met and the data
    needed to evaluate this condition is not known until previously started tasks
    finish. In this way, the setup handler dynamically decides whether to start the
    corresponding task normally or skip it and report success or an error.
    For more information about inter-task data exchange, see \l Storage.

    \section2 Task's Done Handler

    When a running task finishes, the task tree invokes an optionally provided done handler.
    The handler should take a \c const \e reference to the associated task class object:

    \code
        const auto onSetup = [](QProcess &process) {
            process.setProgram("sleep");
            process.setArguments({"3"});
        };
        const auto onDone = [](const QProcess &process, DoneWith result) {
            if (result == DoneWith::Success)
                qDebug() << "Success" << process.cleanedStdOut();
            else
                qDebug() << "Failure" << process.cleanedStdErr();
        };
        const Group root {
            QProcessTask(onSetup, onDone)
        };
    \endcode

    The done handler may collect output data from QProcess, and store it
    for further processing or perform additional actions.

    \note If the task setup handler returns StopWithSuccess or StopWithError,
          the done handler is not invoked.

    \section1 Group Handlers

    Similarly to task handlers, group handlers enable you to set up a group to
    execute and to apply more actions when the whole group finishes with
    success or an error.

    \section2 Group's Start Handler

    The task tree invokes the group start handler before it starts the child
    tasks. The group handler doesn't take any arguments:

    \code
        const auto onSetup = [] {
            qDebug() << "Entering the group";
        };
        const Group root {
            onGroupSetup(onSetup),
            QProcessTask(...)
        };
    \endcode

    The group setup handler is optional. To define a group setup handler, add an
    onGroupSetup() element to a group. The argument of onGroupSetup() is a user
    handler. If you add more than one onGroupSetup() element to a group, an assert
    is triggered at runtime that includes an error message.

    Like the task's start handler, the group start handler may return SetupResult.
    The returned SetupResult value affects the start behavior of the
    whole group. If you do not specify a group start handler or its return type
    is void, the default group's action is SetupResult::Continue, so that all
    tasks are started normally. Otherwise, when the start handler returns
    SetupResult::StopWithSuccess or SetupResult::StopWithError, the tasks are not
    started (they are skipped) and the group itself reports success or failure,
    depending on the returned value, respectively.

    \code
        const Group root {
            onGroupSetup([] { qDebug() << "Root setup"; }),
            Group {
                onGroupSetup([] { qDebug() << "Group 1 setup"; return SetupResult::Continue; }),
                QProcessTask(...) // Process 1
            },
            Group {
                onGroupSetup([] { qDebug() << "Group 2 setup"; return SetupResult::StopWithSuccess; }),
                QProcessTask(...) // Process 2
            },
            Group {
                onGroupSetup([] { qDebug() << "Group 3 setup"; return SetupResult::StopWithError; }),
                QProcessTask(...) // Process 3
            },
            QProcessTask(...) // Process 4
        };
    \endcode

    In the above example, all subgroups of a root group define their setup handlers.
    The following scenario assumes that all started processes finish with success:

    \table
    \header
        \li Scenario
        \li Comment
    \row
        \li Root Group starts
        \li Doesn't return SetupResult, so its tasks are executed.
    \row
        \li Group 1 starts
        \li Returns Continue, so its tasks are executed.
    \row
        \li Process 1 starts
        \li
    \row
        \li ...
        \li ...
    \row
        \li Process 1 finishes (success)
        \li
    \row
        \li Group 1 finishes (success)
        \li
    \row
        \li Group 2 starts
        \li Returns StopWithSuccess, so Process 2 is skipped and Group 2 reports
            success.
    \row
        \li Group 2 finishes (success)
        \li
    \row
        \li Group 3 starts
        \li Returns StopWithError, so Process 3 is skipped and Group 3 reports
            an error.
    \row
        \li Group 3 finishes (error)
        \li
    \row
        \li Root Group finishes (error)
        \li Group 3, which is a direct child of the root group, finished with an
            error, so the root group stops executing, skips Process 4, which has
            not started yet, and reports an error.
    \endtable

    \section2 Groups's Done Handler

    A Group's done handler is executed after the successful or failed execution of its tasks.
    The final value reported by the group depends on its \l {Workflow Policy}.
    The handler can apply other necessary actions.
    The done handler is defined inside the onGroupDone() element of a group.
    It may take the optional DoneWith argument, indicating the successful or failed execution:

    \code
        const Group root {
            onGroupSetup([] { qDebug() << "Root setup"; }),
            QProcessTask(...),
            onGroupDone([](DoneWith result) {
                if (result == DoneWith::Success)
                    qDebug() << "Root finished with success";
                else
                    qDebug() << "Root finished with an error";
            })
        };
    \endcode

    The group done handler is optional. If you add more than one onGroupDone() to a group,
    an assert is triggered at runtime that includes an error message.

    \note Even if the group setup handler returns StopWithSuccess or StopWithError,
    the group's done handler is invoked. This behavior differs from that of task done handler
    and might change in the future.

    \section1 Other Group Elements

    A group can contain other elements that describe the processing flow, such as
    the execution mode or workflow policy. It can also contain storage elements
    that are responsible for collecting and sharing custom common data gathered
    during group execution.

    \section2 Execution Mode

    The execution mode element in a Group specifies how the direct child tasks of
    the Group are started. The most common execution modes are \l sequential and
    \l parallel. It's also possible to specify the limit of tasks running
    in parallel by using the parallelLimit() function.

    In all execution modes, a group starts tasks in the oder in which they appear.

    If a child of a group is also a group, the child group runs its tasks
    according to its own execution mode.

    \section2 Workflow Policy

    The workflow policy element in a Group specifies how the group should behave
    when any of its \e direct child's tasks finish. For a detailed description of possible
    policies, refer to WorkflowPolicy.

    If a child of a group is also a group, the child group runs its tasks
    according to its own workflow policy.

    \section2 Storage

    Use the \l {Tasking::Storage} {Storage} element to exchange information between tasks.
    Especially, in the sequential execution mode, when a task needs data from another,
    already finished task, before it can start. For example, a task tree that copies data by reading
    it from a source and writing it to a destination might look as follows:

    \code
        static QByteArray load(const QString &fileName) { ... }
        static void save(const QString &fileName, const QByteArray &array) { ... }

        static Group copyRecipe(const QString &source, const QString &destination)
        {
            struct CopyStorage { // [1] custom inter-task struct
                QByteArray content; // [2] custom inter-task data
            };

            // [3] instance of custom inter-task struct manageable by task tree
            const Storage<CopyStorage> storage;

            const auto onLoaderSetup = [source](ConcurrentCall<QByteArray> &async) {
                async.setConcurrentCallData(&load, source);
            };
            // [4] runtime: task tree activates the instance from [7] before invoking handler
            const auto onLoaderDone = [storage](const ConcurrentCall<QByteArray> &async) {
                storage->content = async.result(); // [5] loader stores the result in storage
            };

            // [4] runtime: task tree activates the instance from [7] before invoking handler
            const auto onSaverSetup = [storage, destination](ConcurrentCall<void> &async) {
                const QByteArray content = storage->content; // [6] saver takes data from storage
                async.setConcurrentCallData(&save, destination, content);
            };
            const auto onSaverDone = [](const ConcurrentCall<void> &async) {
                qDebug() << "Save done successfully";
            };

            const Group root {
                // [7] runtime: task tree creates an instance of CopyStorage when root is entered
                storage,
                ConcurrentCallTask<QByteArray>(onLoaderSetup, onLoaderDone, CallDoneIf::Success),
                ConcurrentCallTask<void>(onSaverSetup, onSaverDone, CallDoneIf::Success)
            };
            return root;
        }

        const QString source = ...;
        const QString destination = ...;
        TaskTree taskTree(copyRecipe(source, destination));
        connect(&taskTree, &TaskTree::done,
                &taskTree, [](DoneWith result) {
            if (result == DoneWith::Success)
                qDebug() << "The copying finished successfully.";
        });
        tasktree.start();
    \endcode

    In the example above, the inter-task data consists of a QByteArray content
    variable [2] enclosed in a \c CopyStorage custom struct [1]. If the loader
    finishes successfully, it stores the data in a \c CopyStorage::content
    variable [5]. The saver then uses the variable to configure the saving task [6].

    To enable a task tree to manage the \c CopyStorage struct, an instance of
    \l {Tasking::Storage} {Storage}<\c CopyStorage> is created [3]. If a copy of this object is
    inserted as the group's child item [7], an instance of the \c CopyStorage struct is
    created dynamically when the task tree enters this group. When the task
    tree leaves this group, the existing instance of the \c CopyStorage struct is
    destructed as it's no longer needed.

    If several task trees holding a copy of the common
    \l {Tasking::Storage} {Storage}<\c CopyStorage> instance run simultaneously
    (including the case when the task trees are run in different threads),
    each task tree contains its own copy of the \c CopyStorage struct.

    You can access \c CopyStorage from any handler in the group with a storage object.
    This includes all handlers of all descendant tasks of the group with
    a storage object. To access the custom struct in a handler, pass the
    copy of the \l {Tasking::Storage} {Storage}<\c CopyStorage> object to the handler
    (for example, in a lambda capture) [4].

    When the task tree invokes a handler in a subtree containing the storage [7],
    the task tree activates its own \c CopyStorage instance inside the
    \l {Tasking::Storage} {Storage}<\c CopyStorage> object. Therefore, the \c CopyStorage struct
    may be accessed only from within the handler body. To access the currently active
    \c CopyStorage from within \l {Tasking::Storage} {Storage}<\c CopyStorage>, use the
    \l {Tasking::Storage::operator->()} {Storage::operator->()},
    \l {Tasking::Storage::operator*()} {Storage::operator*()}, or Storage::activeStorage() method.

    The following list summarizes how to employ a Storage object into the task
    tree:
    \list 1
        \li Define the custom structure \c MyStorage with custom data [1], [2]
        \li Create an instance of the \l {Tasking::Storage} {Storage}<\c MyStorage> storage [3]
        \li Pass the \l {Tasking::Storage} {Storage}<\c MyStorage> instance to handlers [4]
        \li Access the \c MyStorage instance in handlers [5], [6]
        \li Insert the \l {Tasking::Storage} {Storage}<\c MyStorage> instance into a group [7]
    \endlist

    \section1 TaskTree class

    TaskTree executes the tree structure of asynchronous tasks according to the
    recipe described by the Group root element.

    As TaskTree is also an asynchronous task, it can be a part of another TaskTree.
    To place a nested TaskTree inside another TaskTree, insert the TaskTreeTask
    element into another Group element.

    TaskTree reports progress of completed tasks when running. The progress value
    is increased when a task finishes or is skipped or canceled.
    When TaskTree is finished and the TaskTree::done() signal is emitted,
    the current value of the progress equals the maximum progress value.
    Maximum progress equals the total number of asynchronous tasks in a tree.
    A nested TaskTree is counted as a single task, and its child tasks are not
    counted in the top level tree. Groups themselves are not counted as tasks,
    but their tasks are counted. \l {Tasking::Sync} {Sync} tasks are not asynchronous,
    so they are not counted as tasks.

    To set additional initial data for the running tree, modify the storage
    instances in a tree when it creates them by installing a storage setup
    handler:

    \code
        Storage<CopyStorage> storage;
        const Group root = ...; // storage placed inside root's group and inside handlers
        TaskTree taskTree(root);
        auto initStorage = [](CopyStorage &storage) {
            storage.content = "initial content";
        };
        taskTree.onStorageSetup(storage, initStorage);
        taskTree.start();
    \endcode

    When the running task tree creates a \c CopyStorage instance, and before any
    handler inside a tree is called, the task tree calls the initStorage handler,
    to enable setting up initial data of the storage, unique to this particular
    run of taskTree.

    Similarly, to collect some additional result data from the running tree,
    read it from storage instances in the tree when they are about to be
    destroyed. To do this, install a storage done handler:

    \code
        Storage<CopyStorage> storage;
        const Group root = ...; // storage placed inside root's group and inside handlers
        TaskTree taskTree(root);
        auto collectStorage = [](const CopyStorage &storage) {
            qDebug() << "final content" << storage.content;
        };
        taskTree.onStorageDone(storage, collectStorage);
        taskTree.start();
    \endcode

    When the running task tree is about to destroy a \c CopyStorage instance, the
    task tree calls the collectStorage handler, to enable reading the final data
    from the storage, unique to this particular run of taskTree.

    \section1 Task Adapters

    To extend a TaskTree with a new task type, implement a simple adapter class
    derived from the TaskAdapter class template. The following class is an
    adapter for a single shot timer, which may be considered as a new asynchronous task:

    \code
        class TimerTaskAdapter : public TaskAdapter<QTimer>
        {
        public:
            TimerTaskAdapter() {
                task()->setSingleShot(true);
                task()->setInterval(1000);
                connect(task(), &QTimer::timeout, this, [this] { emit done(DoneResult::Success); });
            }
        private:
            void start() final { task()->start(); }
        };

        using TimerTask = CustomTask<TimerTaskAdapter>;
    \endcode

    You must derive the custom adapter from the TaskAdapter class template
    instantiated with a template parameter of the class implementing a running
    task. The code above uses QTimer to run the task. This class appears
    later as an argument to the task's handlers. The instance of this class
    parameter automatically becomes a member of the TaskAdapter template, and is
    accessible through the TaskAdapter::task() method. The constructor
    of \c TimerTaskAdapter initially configures the QTimer object and connects
    to the QTimer::timeout() signal. When the signal is triggered, \c TimerTaskAdapter
    emits the TaskInterface::done(DoneResult::Success) signal to inform the task tree that
    the task finished successfully. If it emits TaskInterface::done(DoneResult::Error),
    the task finished with an error.
    The TaskAdapter::start() method starts the timer.

    To make QTimer accessible inside TaskTree under the \c TimerTask name,
    define \c TimerTask to be an alias to the CustomTask<\c TimerTaskAdapter>.
    \c TimerTask becomes a new custom task type, using \c TimerTaskAdapter.

    The new task type is now registered, and you can use it in TaskTree:

    \code
        const auto onSetup = [](QTimer &task) { task.setInterval(2000); };
        const auto onDone = [] { qDebug() << "timer triggered"; };
        const Group root {
            TimerTask(onSetup, onDone)
        };
    \endcode

    When a task tree containing the root from the above example is started, it
    prints a debug message within two seconds and then finishes successfully.

    \note The class implementing the running task should have a default constructor,
    and objects of this class should be freely destructible. It should be allowed
    to destroy a running object, preferably without waiting for the running task
    to finish (that is, safe non-blocking destructor of a running task).
    To achieve a non-blocking destruction of a task that has a blocking destructor,
    consider using the optional \c Deleter template parameter of the TaskAdapter.

    \typealias Tasking::TimeoutTask

    Type alias for the CustomTask, to be used inside recipes, associated with the
    \c std::chrono::milliseconds type. \c std::chrono::milliseconds is used to set up the
    timeout duration. The default timeout is \c std::chrono::milliseconds::zero(), that is,
    the TimeoutTask finishes as soon as the control returns to the running event loop.

    Example usage:

    \code
        using namespace std::chrono;
        using namespace std::chrono_literals;

        const auto onSetup = [](milliseconds &timeout) { timeout = 1000ms; }
